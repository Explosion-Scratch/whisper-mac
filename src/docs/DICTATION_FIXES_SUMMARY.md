# Dictation Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. First Run Audio Capture Failure
**Problem**: Dictation window fails to capture audio on first run.

**Fixes**:
- Enhanced VAD initialization in `src/renderer/dictationWindow.html`:
  - Pre-enumerate microphone devices before VAD setup
  - Improved permission request flow with validation  
  - Better device availability checking and fallback logic
  - Increased initialization timing delays (200ms vs 150ms)

- Improved microphone device service caching in `src/services/MicrophoneDeviceService.ts`:
  - Added 5-second cache duration to prevent redundant enumeration
  - Race condition prevention for concurrent calls
  - Cache invalidation on app startup

### 2. Window State Race Conditions  
**Problem**: Inconsistent window hiding/showing causing race conditions.

**Fixes**:
- Added `pendingVisibilityChange` flag in `src/services/DictationWindowService.ts`
- Proper visibility state tracking with `isWindowVisible` property
- Window event listeners for show/hide to maintain consistent state
- Increased window initialization delays for better reliability

### 3. Microphone Selection Robustness
**Problem**: Selected microphone not always used correctly.

**Fixes**:  
- Device enumeration exposed via IPC (`enumerate-microphones`)
- Pre-validation of selected devices before stream creation
- Enhanced fallback logic when selected device unavailable
- Better logging for device selection debugging

## Technical Changes

### Core Files Modified:
- `src/renderer/dictationWindow.html` - Enhanced VAD initialization
- `src/services/DictationWindowService.ts` - Race condition prevention
- `src/services/MicrophoneDeviceService.ts` - Improved caching
- `src/preload/dictationPreload.ts` - Added device enumeration IPC
- `src/core/IpcHandlerManager.ts` - Added enumerate-microphones handler

### Key Improvements:
- Timing: Increased delays for better first-run reliability
- Caching: 5-second device enumeration cache 
- Validation: Pre-check device availability before use
- State: Consistent window visibility tracking
- Fallback: Better error handling and default device usage

## Testing
Test scenarios:
1. **First Run**: Clear app data, launch and test dictation immediately
2. **Device Changes**: Switch microphone in settings, verify proper usage
3. **Rapid Actions**: Quickly show/hide window to test race conditions
